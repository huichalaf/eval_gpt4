The subset is closed: This means that its complement is open.\n2. The subset is bounded: This means that there exists a positive real number R such that for every point in the subset, the distance between that point and any fixed point in the metric space is less than or equal to R.\n\nLet's prove each of these statements:\n\n1. To show that the subset is closed, we will show that its complement is open. Let A be a compact subset of M, and let B = M \\ A be its complement. We want to show that B is open.\n\nTake any point x in B. Since x is not in A, it must have a positive distance from A. Let's denote this distance as r > 0.\n\nConsider the set of all points y in M such that d(x, y) < r/2. This set can be denoted as N_r/2(x). We claim that N_r/2(x) does not intersect with A.\n\nSuppose there exists a point y in N_r/2(x) which belongs to A. Then we have d(x, y) < r/2 and y belongs to A. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover for A consisting of open sets {U_i} for i = 1 to n.\n\nNow consider the open cover {N_r/2(y)} for all points y in this finite subcover. Since each N_r/2(y) does not intersect with A by construction, it follows that their union also does not intersect with A.\n\nHowever, since A is covered by {U_i}, we can choose one U_i containing x. Since U_i contains x and U_i intersects with N_r/2(x), it follows that U_i intersects with A, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, N_r/2(x) does not intersect with A. This means that N_r/2(x) is a subset of B. Since this holds for every point x in B, we can conclude that B is open, which implies that A is closed.\n\n2. To show that the subset is bounded, we will use the fact that it is compact. Since A is compact, it can be covered by a finite number of open balls of radius 1 centered at some points in M.

This means that for every point (x,y) in [0,1] x [0,1], there exists an open set U containing (x,y) such that U is a subset of [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nSince U is an open set containing (x,y), there exists an open ball centered at (x,y) that is completely contained within U. Let's denote this open ball as B(x,y).\n\nNow let's consider the collection of all such open balls B(x,y) for every point (x,y) in [0,1] x [0,1]. This collection forms an open cover of [0,1] x [0,1], since for every point (x,y) in [0,1] x [0,1], there exists an open ball B(x,y) in the collection that contains (x,y).\n\nBy assumption, this collection is an open cover of [0,1] x [0,1]. Since the closed interval is bounded and closed in RR (since it includes its endpoints), by the Heine-Borel theorem we know that it is compact. Therefore this collection has a finite subcover.\n\nThis means that we can select a finite number of open balls from the collection such that their union covers all points in [0,1] x [0,1]. Let's denote this finite subcover as {B(x_i,y_i)} where i = 1 to n.\n\nSince each B(x_i,y_i) is completely contained within some U_i, we can construct a finite subcover of U_i's by selecting the corresponding U_i for each B(x_i,y_i). Therefore, we have found a finite subcover of the original open cover of [0,1] x [0,1].\n\nSince this holds for an arbitrary open cover of [0,1] x [0,1], we can conclude that [0,1] x [0,1] is compact in RR.", "To find the critical points of the function \\(f(x, y) = x^2 + xy + y^2\\), we need to find where its partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are equal to zero.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + y\\)\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we have:\n\\(2x + y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -2x\\)\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x + 2y\\)\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we have:\n\\(x + 2y = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2y\\)\n\nNow, we can substitute one equation into the other to solve for the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) at the critical points.

Movement: At each step, the walker randomly moves either to the left or to the right with equal probability. The movement is independent of previous steps.\n\n3. Expected Displacement: On average, the walker takes an equal number of steps to the left and to the right since it is symmetric. Therefore, the expected displacement after each step is 0.\n\n4.

Therefore, by our previous argument, there exists a neighborhood N_y such that N_y is completely contained within A_k^c.\n\nNow let's consider the intersection of all these neighborhoods N_x and N_y for all points x and y in B^c. Since each N_x and N_y are open sets (as complements of closed sets), their intersection must also be an open set.\n\nTherefore, for every point y in B^c, there exists a neighborhood N_y such that N_y is completely contained within B^c. This shows that B^c is open.\n\nSince the complement of B (i.e., B^c) is open, we can conclude that B is a closed set.

One of the axioms in this system is the Power Set Axiom. \n\nThe Power Set Axiom states that for any set A, there exists a set B whose members are exactly the subsets of A. In other words, if we have a set A, we can always construct another set B which contains all possible subsets of A.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n\n\u2200A \u2203B \u2200x [x \u2208 B \u2194 x \u2286 A]\n\nwhere:\n- \u2200 means \"for all\"\n- \u2203 means \"there exists\"\n- x \u2286 y means \"x is a subset of y\"\n\nNow let's prove this from other axioms using only basic logical reasoning.\n\n1.

Uniqueness: If there were two different power sets for a given set (say B and C), then there would be some element in one but not in another - which contradicts our definition that every element must be in both sets if it's in either one because every subset must be included.\n\nTherefore, using ZF axioms including the Power Set axiom we can prove that for any given set there exists a power set containing all its subsets.\n", "Sure, let's break this down.\n\n1. **Compactness in Metric Space**: A subset A of a metric space (M, d) is said to be compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. \n\n2. **Closedness**: We want to show that if a set A is compact, then it is also closed. \n\n   To prove this, we'll use the concept of limit points. \n\n   Suppose x is a limit point of A (i.e., for every r > 0, B(x,r) intersects A at some point other than x). We need to show that x belongs to A.\n\n   Let's consider an open cover for {x} and {A}. This open cover has no finite subcover because removing any open set from it would still contain x which contradicts with our assumption that x is a limit point and not an element of A.\n\n   But since our original set was compact, it should have had a finite subcover for all its subsets including {x} and {A}.

An open cover is a collection of open sets whose union contains the set being covered. For our purposes here, we can consider an open cover to be any collection of sets that includes some neighborhood around each point in [0,1]. \n\n4. **Finite Subcover**: According to our definition of compactness above, to show that [0,1] is compact we need to show that for every open cover there exists a finite subcover.\n\n5. Let's consider an arbitrary open cover for [0,1]. This can be written as {U\u03b1}, where \u03b1 ranges over some index set I (which may be infinite). \n\n6. For each x in [0,1], there must exist some U\u03b1 such that x \u2208 U\u03b1 because our collection {U\u03b1} covers every point.\n\n7. Since each U\u03b1 contains some neighborhood around its corresponding x value and there are only finitely many such neighborhoods within the interval from 0 to 1 (including endpoints), we can select finitely many sets from our original collection such that their union still covers all points in [0,1].\n\n8. Therefore, we have shown that for every open cover of [0,1], there exists a finite subcover.\n\n9. This satisfies our definition of compactness, so we conclude that the closed interval [0,1] is compact in the Euclidean space R.\n\n10. Since a closed interval in R^n can be thought of as just an n-dimensional Cartesian product of closed intervals in R (for each coordinate), we can extend this result to say that the closed rectangle [0,1]x[0,1] (or more generally, any closed rectangle) is compact in R^2 (or more generally, in any higher-dimensional Euclidean space).\n\nThis completes our proof.", "Sure, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the First-Order Partial Derivatives\n\nThe first step in finding critical points is to find the first-order partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable. In this case, we have a function f(x, y) = x^2 + xy + y^2. \n\nSo, we differentiate f(x,y) with respect to x and y:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 2x + y   ... (1)\n\n\u2202f/\u2202y = x + 2y   ... (2)\n\nStep 2: Set the First-Order Partial Derivatives Equal to Zero\n\nTo find critical points, we set these first-order partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y.\n\nSetting equation (1) equal to zero gives us:\n\n2x + y = 0   =>   y = -2x    ... (3)\n\nSetting equation (2) equal to zero gives us:\n\nx + 2y = 0   =>   x = -4y    ... (4)\n\nStep 3: Substitute Values of x and y into Original Function\n\nSubstitute these values of x and y back into our original function f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.\n\nThis gives us:\n\nf(-4y, y) = (-4y)^2 + (-4y)y + y^2 \n          = 16y^2 -16y^2 + y^2 \n          = y^2\n\nSo, our function reduces to just f(y) = y^\u00b2 after substituting for critical points.\n\nStep 4: Classify Critical Points using Second-Order Partial Derivatives Test\n\nWe can now use the Second-Order Partial Derivatives Test to classify these critical points as local minima, local maxima or saddle points.\n\nThe test involves calculating the determinant D and the discriminant B of the Hessian matrix:\n\nD = f_xx * f_yy - (f_xy)^2\nB = f_xx + f_yy\n\nIf D > 0 and B > 0, then it's a local minimum.\nIf D > 0 and B < 0, then it's a local maximum.\nIf D < 0, then it's a saddle point.\n\nHowever, in our case both D and B are always equal to -4 which is less than zero. So according to second derivative test we have a saddle point at every critical point.\n\nTherefore, all critical points of \\(f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2\\) are saddle points.", "In a simple symmetric one-dimensional random walk, we start at a position (usually 0) and at each step, we move one unit to the right or left with equal probability. This can be modeled as a sequence of independent random variables, where each variable takes on the value +1 (for moving right) or -1 (for moving left) with equal probability.\n\nLet's denote the number of steps as n. \n\nThe expected position after nn steps can be found by considering that for every step you take to the right, there is a step you take to the left that cancels it out. Therefore, on average, you will stay in the same position.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nE(X_n) = X_0 + p*X_1 + q*X_2 + ... + p^(n-1)*X_(n-1)\n\nwhere:\n- E(X_n) is the expected position after n steps,\n- X_i represents your position after i steps,\n- p is the probability of moving right (which equals 0.5),\n- q is the probability of moving left (also equals 0.5).\n\nSince for every i from 1 to n-1, X_i = X_0 (the starting position), this simplifies to:\n\nE(X_n) = X_0 + p*(X_0 + X_0 + ... + X_0)\n       = X_0\n\nSo regardless of how many steps you take in either direction, on average you will end up back at your starting point.\n\nThis result makes intuitive sense since in a symmetric random walk there's an equal chance to move left or right at each step and over many trials these movements will cancel out leading to no net movement away from starting point.\n", "In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is a concept in which the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice.

It allows us to update our knowledge or beliefs about an event based on new information or evidence.\n\nFor example, consider rolling two dice where X represents the number on one die and Y represents the number on other die. If we know that one die shows 3 (i.e., Y=3), then our sample space reduces to only those outcomes where second die shows any number from 1 to 6 but with equal probabilities for each outcome i.e., {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So if we are interested in finding out what's on first die given this information (i.e., X|Y=3), then we would assign equal probabilities to each outcome from {1,2,3,4,5,6} as each one has same chance of appearing on first die when second shows any number from {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Solving it for \u03bb gives us our eigenvalues.\n\nWe can factorize this quadratic equation as follows: \n(\u03bb -5)(\u03bb -2)=0\n\nSo, \u03bb\u2081=5 and \u03bb\u2082=2 are our eigenvalues.\n\nStep 2: Find Eigenvectors\nTo find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, we substitute each eigenvalue back into (A - \u03bbI)x =0 where I is identity matrix and x is column vector representing eigenvector.\n\nFor \u03bb\u2081=5:\n(A - 5I)x =0 \n=> \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ \n                   2 & -2 \n\\end{pmatrix}\\)x=0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n-x + x =0 \nor simply,\n0=0\n\nThis means that x can be any non-zero vector. We usually choose x=[1;0] or x=[0;1]. \n\nFor \u03bb\u2082=2:\n(A - 2I)x =0 \n=> \\(\\begin{pmatrix}   2 &   1 \\\\ \n                     \t2 &   1 \n\t\t\\end{pmatrix}\\)x=0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n2x + x =0 \nor simply,\n3x=0\n\nThis means that x=[1;-2] or any scalar multiple of it will be an eigenvector.\n\nSo, the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues \u03bb\u2081=5 and \u03bb\u2082=2 are [1;0], [0;1] and [1;-2] respectively.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues for matrix A are \u03bb\u2081=5 and \u03bb\u2082=2 with corresponding eigenvectors v\u2081=[1;0], v\u2082=[0;1] and v\u2083=[1;-2].", "Sure, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the cost of one pencil\nSince 5 pencils cost $1.25, we can find the cost of one pencil by dividing the total cost by the number of pencils. So,\n1.25 / 5 = $0.25\n\nStep 2: Multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils you want to find out\nWe have already found out that each pencil costs $0.25 in Step 1. Now we need to multiply this amount by 12 (the number of pencils we want to find out).

The empty set and X itself are both open.\n2. The intersection of any finite number of open sets is also open.\n3. The union of any arbitrary (possibly infinite) number of open sets is also open.\n\nA basis B for a topological space (X,T) is a collection of subsets of X such that every open set in T can be written as a union of some subcollection in B. In other words, for any point x in X and any neighborhood N of x (where N is an open set containing x), there exists some element B_i in B such that x \u2208 B_i \u2286 N.\n\nNow let's prove that the set of all open intervals in \u211d forms a basis for the standard topology on \u211d.\n\n1. Every element B_i in this basis consists entirely of real numbers and thus it's an element from \u211d.\n2. For any point x in \u211d and any neighborhood N = (a,b) containing x where a < x < b, we can always find another interval (c,d) such that c < x < d and this new interval will be entirely contained within N.

Plotting this line gives us:\n\ny= -x+4\n\nThis line has intercepts at (0,4) and (4,0).\n\nSince we also have constraints that say both x and y must be greater than or equal to zero, our feasible region is below this line but above or on top of each axis.\n\nStep 5: Find Critical Points\nNext we need to find critical points within our feasible region. These are places where either our objective function has its maximum value or where it doesn't exist because there's no more area left for us to consider due to other constraints.\n\nIn this case there's only one critical point which occurs at intersection point between our first constraint line with each axis - so it's just at point (0,0).\n\nStep 6: Evaluate Objective Function at Critical Points\nNow we substitute these critical points back into our original equation for what we're trying to maximize: z=3x+4y.\n\nWhen x=0 and y=0, z=3*0+4*0 which simplifies down to z=0.\n\nSo, the maximum value of z is 0 which occurs when both x and y are equal to zero.", "A group is a set G together with an operation * (denoted as (G, *)) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, denoted as a * b.

Inverse element: For each element a in G, there exists an element b in G such that their product is the identity element e.\n\nNow let's prove that the set of integers Z under addition forms a group.\n\n1. Closure: If you add any two integers together, you always get another integer. So for all integers a and b, we have that a + b is also an integer.\n\n2. Associativity: This property holds for addition of integers no matter how many numbers are being added. For any three integers a,b,c we have (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). \n\n3.

This means that every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to an element in the space.\n\nHere are the steps to prove this:\n\n1. **Cauchy Sequence**: Let {x_n} be a Cauchy sequence in the Hilbert space H. This means that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists N such that for all m, n > N, we have ||x_m - x_n|| < \u03b5.\n\n2. **Completeness**: A Hilbert space is complete, i.e., all Cauchy sequences converge to a limit which is also in H.\n\n3. **Convergence**: Since {x_n} is a Cauchy sequence in H and H is complete, there exists an element x in H such that lim_{n->\u221e} x_n = x.\n\n4. **Limit is in Space**: We need to show that this limit x actually belongs to our original Hilbert space H. \n\n5. **Closedness under Limit Operations**: For any two elements y,z \u2208 H and any scalar \u03b1, consider their linear combination \u03b1y + (1-\u03b1)z which lies within our original Hilbert Space due to its closedness under linear combinations.\n\n6. **Limit of Linear Combinations**: Taking limits on both sides as n \u2192 \u221e gives us \u03b1lim_{n->\u221e} y_n + (1-\u03b1)lim_{n->\u221e} z_n = \u03b1x + (1-\u03b1)x = x which shows that x also lies within our original Hilbert Space due to its closedness under limits of linear combinations.\n\nTherefore, every Cauchy sequence in a Hilbert space converges to an element within that same Hilbert space.\n", "The Residue Theorem is used to evaluate contour integrals, not definite integrals like the one you've provided. \n\nThe Residue Theorem states that if f(z) is analytic in a simply connected domain except at a finite number of singular points, and \u03b3 is a simple closed curve in this domain that does not pass through any of these singularities, then \u222e\u03b3f(z)dz = 2\u03c0i\u2211Res(f, z_i), where the sum is taken over all singular points inside \u03b3 and Res(f, z_i) denotes the residue of f at z_i.\n\nHowever, in your case you have a definite integral from -\u221e to +\u221e. This type of integral often appears when we use complex analysis to evaluate real integrals. \n\nWe can solve this problem using the Residue Theorem by considering a semicircular contour in the upper half plane (or lower half plane). Let's denote this contour as C_R and it consists of three parts: \n\n1. A straight line segment from -R to R along the real axis.\n2. A semicircular arc from R to -R in the upper half-plane (or lower half-plane).\n\nAs R tends to infinity, the integral over part 2 tends to zero because as |z| increases on part 2, |z^2 + 1| also increases but remains bounded by some constant M say.

Squaring a negative exponent will make it positive.

The integral of sin(x) with respect to x is -cos(x).

First, we know that the order of a group is the number of elements in the group. So, if a group has order p^2 (where p is a prime), it means that it has p*p = p\u00b2 elements.\n\n2. By Lagrange's Theorem, for any element g in G (the group), the order of g divides the order of G. In other words, if we take any non-identity element in G, its order must be either p or 1 (which means it's the identity element).\n\n3. Now consider an arbitrary group element x \u2260 e (where e is the identity). The cyclic subgroup generated by x must have at least p elements: {e, x, x^2,... ,x^(p-1)}. This is because if any two powers were equal (say x^i = x^j where i < j), then multiplying both sides by x^-i would give us e = x^(j-i), contradicting our assumption that all powers are distinct.\n\n4. Since there are only p\u00b2 total elements in G but at least p distinct non-identity elements (one for each cyclic subgroup), there can't be any more non-identity elements left to form new cyclic subgroups with.\n\n5. Therefore every non-identity element generates a cyclic subgroup of size exactly p.\n\n6. If every element generates a subgroup of size exactly p, then all these subgroups must be identical because they're all generated by different powers of different elements but have same number of elements and hence same structure.\n\n7. This means that for any two elements x and y in G (including possibly e), their corresponding subgroups <x> and <y> are identical.\n\n8. In general, if H and K are two subgroups such that H \u2286 K or K \u2286 H, then HK = KH. This can be proven by showing that any element in HK must also be in KH and vice versa.\n\n9. So for any two elements x and y in G, we have xy = yx because their corresponding subgroups are identical.\n\n10. Thus, every group of order p^2 where p is prime is abelian (i.e., its elements commute with each other).\n\nThis completes the proof.", "This is a system of three linear congruences.

We want to show that \u222e_\u03b3\u2592f(z)dz=0.\nSince U is simply connected, there exists a homotopy H from \u03b3 to a constant loop at some point p in U.\nBy definition of homotopy, for each t in [0,1], H_t(\u00b7)=H(\u00b7,t):[0,1]\u2192U gives us a path from \u03b3 to p.\nBy applying Cauchy's Integral Theorem along each H_t(\u00b7), we get that for each t,\n\u222e_(H_t)\u2592f(z)dz=0.\nBut this means that d/dt(\u222e_(H_t)\u2592f(z)dz)=0.\nBy Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Complex Integrals, we have\nd/dt(\u222e_(H_t)\u2592f(z)dz)=\u222e_\u03b3\u2592f(z)dz-0=\u222e_\u03b3\u2592f(z)dz.\nSo, \u222e_\u03b3\u2592f(z)dz=0.\n\nExample:\nLet's evaluate the integral \u222b_C\u25921/z dz where C is any closed curve not passing through the origin.\n\nWe know that this function f(z)=1/z is holomorphic on its domain (except at z=0). By Cauchy's Integral Theorem, since f has an antiderivative (logarithm), we have:\n\n\u222b_C\u25921/z dz = 0\n\nThis result holds true for any closed curve C not passing through the origin.", "The Lebesgue measure is a way of assigning a size to subsets of Euclidean space that generalizes the notion of length, area, and volume. It extends the concept of length from intervals to all subsets in a way that is consistent with our intuitive understanding of size.\n\nFormally, the Lebesgue measure on the real line \u211d is defined as follows:\n\n1. For any interval [a, b], where -\u221e \u2264 a < b \u2264 \u221e, we define its Lebesgue measure m([a, b]) = b - a.\n\n2. If A and B are disjoint sets (i.e., A \u2229 B = \u2205), then m(A \u222a B) = m(A) + m(B). This property is called countable additivity.\n\n3. The Lebesgue measure of any point in \u211d (which can be seen as an interval with both endpoints equal) is zero: m({x}) = 0 for all x \u2208 \u211d.\n\nNow we will prove that every open interval in \u211d is Lebesgue measurable. A set E \u2286 \u211d is said to be Lebesgue measurable if for every subset A \u2286 \u211d,\n\nm*(A) = m*(A \u2229 E) + m*(A \u2229 E^c)\n\nwhere m* denotes the outer measure induced by the Lebesgue measure and E^c denotes the complement of E. \n\nLet's consider an open interval (a,b). We need to show that for any subset A \u2286 \u211d,\n\nm*(A) \u2265 m*(A \u2229 (a,b)) + m*(A \u2229 ((-\u221e,a]\u222a[b,+\u221e)))\n\nBut this follows immediately from countable subadditivity and monotonicity properties of outer measures:\n\nm*(A) \u2265 m*((A \u2229 (-\u221e,a])\u222a(A \u2229 [b,+\u221e]))) \n\u2265 m*(A \u2229 (-\u221e,a]) + m*(A \u2229 [b,+\u221e])) \n= m*(A \u2229 ((-\u221e,a]\u222a[b,+\u221e])))\n\nTherefore, every open interval in \u211d is Lebesgue measurable.\n\nNote: This proof assumes that outer measure induced by Lebesgue measure is indeed a measure.

The properties of a vector space are as follows:\n\n1. Closure under Addition: The sum of any two vectors in V is another vector in V.\n2. Associativity of Addition: For all u, v, w in V, (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).\n3. Commutativity of Addition: For all u and v in V, u + v = v + u.\n4. Existence of Zero Vector: There exists an element 0 in V such that for every element v in V, v + 0 = v.\n5. Existence of Additive Inverses: For every v in V, there exists an element -v in V such that v + (-v) = 0.\n6. Closure under Scalar Multiplication: For any scalar c and any vector v, cv belongs to V.\n7. Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition: For all c and d (scalars), for all vectors v (in our set), c(dv) = (cd)v.\n8. Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Field Addition: For all c (scalar), for all vectors u and v (in our set), c(u+v) = cu+cv.\n9. Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication: If we denote by 1 the multiplicative identity element from the field F , then 1*v=v.\n\nNow let's prove that the set P_n consisting of all polynomials p(x) on a variable x with real coefficients such that deg(p(x)) \u2264 n forms a vector space:\n\n1. Closure under Addition: If p(x) and q(x) are two polynomials in P_n, then their sum p(x) + q(x) is also a polynomial of degree at most n. Therefore, P_n is closed under addition.\n\n2. Associativity of Addition: For any three polynomials p(x), q(x), and r(x) in P_n, we have [p(x) + q(x)] + r(x) = p(x) + [q(x) + r(x)], which shows that addition is associative.\n\n3. Commutativity of Addition: For any two polynomials p(x) and q(x) in P_n, we have p(x) + q(x) = q(x) + p(x), which shows that addition is commutative.\n\n4. Existence of Zero Vector: The zero polynomial 0 belongs to P_n because all its coefficients are zero.\n\n5. Existence of Additive Inverses: For any polynomial p(x), the polynomial -p(-x) belongs to P_n and serves as an additive inverse because [p(-x)]+[(-p)(-x)] = 0 for all x.\n\n6. Closure under Scalar Multiplication: If c is any scalar and p is any polynomial in P_n, then cp will also be a polynomial in P_n because each term in cp will have degree equal to the sum of degrees in c and p, which will be less than or equal to n.\n\n7.

It is a vector space on which a norm is defined. A norm is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to each vector in the space, other than the zero vector. This concept is used to define and measure distances between vectors and generalizes the notion of absolute value in real numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the set C([a,b]) of all continuous real-valued functions on [a,b]. We want to show that this set, when equipped with the supremum norm, forms a normed space.\n\n1. The Supremum Norm: The supremum or uniform norm of a function f : [a,b] -> R is defined as ||f||_\u221e = sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]}. This gives us a way to measure how far apart two functions are at most.\n\n2. Non-negativity: For any function f in C([a,b]), ||f||_\u221e >= 0 because it's an absolute value and thus non-negative.\n\n3. Definiteness: If ||f||_\u221e = 0, then sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]} = 0 which implies that |f(x)| = 0 for all x \u2208 [a,b]. Since f is continuous, this means f must be identically zero on [a,b].\n\n4. Scalar Multiplication: For any scalar c and any function f in C([a,b]), we have ||cf||_\u221e = sup{|cf(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]} = |c| * sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]} = |c| * ||f||_\u221e.\n\n5.

Multiplication has distributive laws over addition: For all elements a,b,c in R, left distributivity: c(a+b) = ca+cb and right distributivity: (a+b)c=ac+bc.\n\nNow let's prove that the set M(2,R) of all 2x2 matrices with real entries forms a non-commutative ring under matrix addition and multiplication.\n\n1. Addition:\n   The set M(2,R) forms an abelian group under addition because:\n   - Addition of matrices is associative.\n   - The zero matrix serves as an identity element.\n   - For every matrix A there exists an additive inverse (-A), such that A+(-A)=0.\n\n2. Multiplication:\n   Matrices are not guaranteed to commute under multiplication. Therefore, we have to show that M(2,R) forms a ring but not necessarily commutative.\n   \n3.

More formally, let (G, *) and (H, \u2022) be two algebraic structures of the same type. A function f: G -> H is said to be a homomorphism if it preserves the operations of the structures, that is for all g1,g2 in G:\n\nf(g1 * g2) = f(g1) \u2022 f(g2)\n\nNow let's prove that the kernel of a group homomorphism is a normal subgroup of the domain.\n\nProof:\nLet (G, *) and (H, \u2022) be groups and let f: G -> H be a group homomorphism. The kernel of f, Ker(f), is defined as the set {g in G : f(g) = e_H}, where e_H is the identity element in H.\n\nWe need to show that Ker(f) is a normal subgroup of G. To do this we need to show three things:\n1. Ker(f) is non-empty.\n2. If x,y are in Ker(f), then so are x*y^-1 and y*x^-1.\n3. For any g in G and k in Ker(f), we have gkg^-1 in Ker(f).\n\nStep 1: \nSince f(e_G) = e_H (where e_G is identity element in G), we have e_G in Ker(f). So Ker(f) is non-empty.\n\nStep 2:\nLet x,y be elements of Ker(f). Then f(x*y^-1)=f(x)*[f(y)]^-1=e_H*[e_H]^-1=e_H*e_H=e_H.\nSo x*y^-1 belongs to Ker(f). Similarly we can show that y*x^-1 also belongs to Ker(f).\n\nStep 3:\nLet g be an element of G and k be an element of Ker(f). Then f(gkg^-1)=f(g)*[f(k)]*[f(g)]^-1=e_H*e_H*e_H=e_H.\nSo gkg^-1 belongs to Ker(f).\n\nSince Ker(f) satisfies all three conditions for being a subgroup and hence it's a subgroup.

Here's a step-by-step proof:\n\n1. **Statement of the Theorem**: Every bounded sequence in \u211d has a convergent subsequence.\n\n2. **Proof**: Let {a_n} be a bounded sequence in \u211d. This means that there exist real numbers M and m such that m \u2264 a_n \u2264 M for all n \u2208 N.\n\n3. Consider the closed interval [m,M]. \n\n4. Divide this interval into two equal halves: [m,(m+M)/2] and [(m+M)/2,M].\n\n5. At least one of these two intervals must contain infinitely many terms of our sequence {a_n}. \n\n   - If not, then there would be only finitely many terms outside these intervals, contradicting that our sequence is infinite.\n   \n6. Choose this half-interval as our \"first\" interval [m_1,M_1].\n\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for this new interval [m_1,M_1], obtaining a nested sequence of closed intervals [m_k,M_k] such that each interval contains infinitely many terms from our original sequence {a_n}.\n\n8. Now consider the corresponding terms a_k (one from each interval). This forms a subsequence {a_{n_k}} which is also bounded (since it's contained within our original bounded sequence).\n\n9. By construction, each term in this subsequence belongs to one of our nested intervals [m_k,M_k]. \n\n10. By Cantor's Intersection Theorem, there exists x \u2208 \u211d such that x is in every closed interval [m_k,M_k].\n\n11. We claim that x = lim_{k\u2192\u221e}a_{n_k}.

Since x is in every interval [m_k,M_k], there exists N such that for all k > N, |x - a_{n_k}| < \u03b5/2 (because x and a_{n_k} are both in [m_N,M_N] for all such k). \n\n12. Since {a_{n_k}} converges to x, there exists K such that for all k > K, |a_{n_k} - x| < \u03b5/2.\n\n13.

The multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm' is a number 'b' such that (a*b) \u2261 1 (mod m). \n\nIn this case, we need to find a number b such that (3*b) \u2261 1 (mod 5). By trial and error, we can see that b=2 works because (3*2)=6 and when we divide it by m=5, we get a remainder of r=1 which satisfies our congruence.\n\nSo, we can multiply both sides of our original congruence by b=2 to eliminate x's coefficient on left side:\n\n2*3x \u2261 2*2 (mod5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n6x \u22614(mod5)\n\nStep 2: Now we have an equation in terms of x with no coefficient in front of x.

The claim is that the intersection of all these sets, \u2229C_i, is also a closed set.\n\nProof:\n\n1. Let's take an arbitrary point x outside of the intersection \u2229C_i. This means that x is not in at least one of the sets C_i.\n\n2. Since each C_i is closed, its complement (the set of all points not in C_i) must be open.\n\n3. Therefore, there exists some neighborhood N(x) around x that is entirely contained within the complement of our particular C_i.\n\n4. But then this neighborhood N(x) does not intersect with our particular C_i (since it's entirely contained within its complement), and hence it doesn't intersect with any other sets in our collection either.\n\n5. So we've shown that for every point outside our intersection, there exists a neighborhood around it that doesn't intersect with any set in our collection.\n\n6. This means that all points outside our intersection are interior points to the complement of \u2229C_i.\n\n7. But if all points outside are interior to its complement, then no point can be a limit point or accumulation point to \u2229C_i from inside or outside because every limit point or accumulation point must have a neighborhood containing infinitely many other points which intersect with some set in our collection but we just showed that no such neighborhood exists for any such limit/accumulation point and hence they don't exist at all inside or outisde \u2229C_i \n\n8. Therefore, every limit/accumulation point must lie inside \u2229C_i itself (if it exists).\n\n9. But if every limit/accumulation point lies inside \u2229C_i itself (if it exists), then by definition \u2229C_i contains all its limit/accumulation points.\n\n10.

Applying this to our function gives us:\n\nf(t) = e^4t*[1/4*(cos(6t+0) + cos(6t-0)) + 1/4*(cos(0))]\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nf(t) = e^4t*[1/2*cos(6t) + 1/4]\n\nStep 2: Apply linearity property\nThe Laplace transform has a linearity property which states that L{af(t)+bg(t)} = aL{f(t)} + bL{g(t)}. We can apply this property to our function.\n\nLet g(t) = 1. Then L{g(t)} = 1/s.\n\nSo, L{f(t)} = e^4 * [L{cos(6t)} / (2s)] + [L{1} / (4s)]\n\nStep 3: Use table values\nWe consult our table of common Laplace transforms and find that L{cos(at)}= s/(s^2+a^2). \n\nPlugging this into our equation gives us:\n\nL{f(t)} = e^4 * [s/(2*(s^2+36))] + [1 / (4*s)]\n\nThis is our final answer for the Laplace transform of e^2t*cos\u2061(3t)*e^2t*cos(3t).", "Sure, let's solve this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify the first term (a), the common difference (d), and the number of terms (n).\n\nIn your sequence, \na = 3 (the first term),\nd = 7 - 3 = 4 (the common difference),\nn = 10 (the number of terms).\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\nSn = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nStep 3: Substitute a, d, and n into the formula.\n\nSubstituting our values into Sn gives us:\n\nS10 = 10/2 * [2*3 + (10-1)*4]\n    = 5 * [6 +9*4]\n    =5*[6+36]\n    =5*[42]\n    =210\n\nSo, the sum of first ten terms in this arithmetic sequence is equal to 210.", "The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers x and y, and any non-negative integer n, the nth power of the sum of x and y can be expressed as a sum of terms each of the form:\n\nC(n, r) * x^(n-r) * y^r\n\nwhere r takes on all possible values from 0 to n, and C(n, r) represents the binomial coefficient which is given by:\n\nn! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nFor our problem, we have (x+2)^4.

The exponent on our base is n=4.\n\nStep 2: Write out all terms.\nWe will have five terms because r goes from 0 to 4 (remember that there are always n+1 terms in total).\n\nThe general term will be C(4,r)*x^(4-r)*y^r.\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n\nWhen r = 0:\nC(4,0)*x^(4-0)*y^0 = 1*1*1 = 1\n\nWhen r = 1:\nC(4,1)*x^(4-1)*y^1 = 4*1*2 = 8\n\nWhen r = 2:\nC(4,2)*x^(4-2)*y^2 =6*16=96\n\nWhen r =3 :\nC(4,3)*x^(5-3)*y^3=24*x*y^3\n=24*(x)*(y*y)\n=24*(x)*(four)\n=96*x\nwhen you substitute \nand you get \n96*x \n\nFinally when r equals to four \nC(5;5-4)*x^(5-4)*y^4\n=1*x*y*y*y*y\n= x* (sixteen)\n=sixteen*x\n\nSo, when you expand (x+2)^4 using the binomial theorem, you get:\nx^4 + 8x^3 + 96x\u00b2 + 384x + 16", "This is a first-order linear differential equation.
