Since p is a limit point, there exists a sequence (pn) in A such that pn converges to p.\n   Since A is compact, there exists a subsequence (pni) of (pn) that converges to some point q in A.\n   But this means that q must also be a limit point of A, since any neighborhood around q contains infinitely many terms from (pni).\n   This contradicts the assumption that p is a limit point not in A.\n   Therefore, every limit point of A must be in A, proving that A is closed.\n\n2. Boundedness:\n   Let's prove by contradiction. Suppose A is not bounded. This means for every real number r, there exists a pair of points x and y in A such that d(x,y) > r.\n   Choose r = 1.

A homomorphism from G to H is a function f: G -> H such that for all elements a and b in G:\n\nf(a * b) = f(a) \u2022 f(b)\n\nIn other words, applying the operation * in G and then mapping it with f is equivalent to mapping the elements individually with f and then applying the operation \u2022 in H.\n\nNow, let's prove that the kernel of a group homomorphism is a normal subgroup of the domain.\n\nProof:\nLet f: G -> H be a group homomorphism, where G is a group with operation * and H is a group with operation \u2022. The kernel of f, denoted as ker(f), is defined as:\n\nker(f) = {g \u2208 G | f(g) = e_H}\n\nwhere e_H represents the identity element in H.\n\nTo prove that ker(f) is a normal subgroup of G, we need to show three things: closure under the group operation *, closure under inverses, and closure under conjugation.\n\n1. Closure under *:\nLet g1, g2 \u2208 ker(f). We need to show that g1 * g2 also belongs to ker(f). Since g1 and g2 are in ker(f), we have:\n\nf(g1) = e_H\nf(g2) = e_H\n\nUsing the homomorphism property:\n\nf(g1 * g2) = f(g1) \u2022 f(g2)\n           = e_H \u2022 e_H\n           = e_H\n\nTherefore, g1 * g2 also belongs to ker(f), proving closure under *.\n\n2. Closure under inverses:\nLet g \u2208 ker(f). We need to show that the inverse of g, denoted as g^(-1), also belongs to ker(f). Since g is in ker(f), we have:\n\nf(g) = e_H\n\nUsing the homomorphism property:\n\nf(g^(-1)) = [f(g)]^(-1)\n          = e_H^(-1)\n          = e_H\n\nTherefore, g^(-1) also belongs to ker(f), proving closure under inverses.\n\n3. Closure under conjugation:\nLet g \u2208 ker(f) and h \u2208 G. We need to show that hgh^(-1) also belongs to ker(f). Since g is in ker(f), we have:\n\nf(g) = e_H\n\nUsing the homomorphism property:\n\nf(hgh^(-1)) = f(h) \u2022 f(g) \u2022 f(h)^(-1)\n            = f(h) \u2022 e_H \u2022 [f(h)]^(-1)\n            = f(h) \u2022 [f(h)]^(-1)\n            = e_H\n\nTherefore, hgh^(-1) also belongs to ker(f), proving closure under conjugation.\n\nSince ker(f) satisfies closure under *, inverses, and conjugation, it is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since it satisfies closure under conjugation, it is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, the kernel of a group homomorphism is a normal subgroup of the domain.", "The Lebesgue measure is a way of assigning a length or volume to subsets of the real line or higher-dimensional spaces. It is named after the French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, who developed it in the early 20th century as an alternative to the traditional notion of length, known as the Jordan measure.\n\nTo define the Lebesgue measure, we start with intervals. An interval in \u211d is a set of the form (a, b), [a, b], (a, b], or [a, b), where a and b are real numbers and a < b. The length of an interval (a, b) is defined as b - a.\n\nThe Lebesgue measure extends this notion to more general sets by considering their \"approximation\" using intervals. Given any subset E \u2286 \u211d, we can define its outer Lebesgue measure m*(E) as follows:\n\nm*(E) = inf{\u2211(b\u1d62 - a\u1d62) : E \u2286 \u22c3(a\u1d62, b\u1d62)}\n\nIn other words, we consider all possible coverings of E by countable unions of open intervals (a\u1d62, b\u1d62), and take the infimum (greatest lower bound) over all such coverings. This gives us an outer measure that assigns a non-negative value to any subset of \u211d.\n\nNow we can define a set E \u2286 \u211d to be Lebesgue measurable if for any subset A \u2286 \u211d,\n\nm*(A) = m*(A \u2229 E) + m*(A \u2229 E^c),\n\nwhere E^c denotes the complement of E in \u211d. In other words, if we can partition A into two disjoint sets A \u2229 E and A \u2229 E^c such that their outer measures add up to the outer measure of A itself.\n\nTo prove that every open interval (a, b) is Lebesgue measurable, we need to show that it satisfies the above condition. Let A \u2286 \u211d be any subset. We consider two cases:\n\n1. If A \u2286 (a, b), then A \u2229 (a, b) = A and A \u2229 (a, b)^c = \u2205. Therefore,\n\nm*(A) = m*(A \u2229 (a, b)) + m*(A \u2229 (a, b)^c)\n      = m*(A) + 0.\n\nThis holds for any subset A \u2286 (a, b), so the condition is satisfied.\n\n2. If A intersects both the open interval (a, b) and its complement, i.e., there exist x < y such that x \u2208 (a, b) and y \u2208 (a, b)^c are both in A. Without loss of generality, assume x < y. Then we can cover A by three disjoint intervals: (-\u221e, x), (x, y), and (y, \u221e). Therefore,\n\nm*(A) \u2264 m*((-\u221e, x)) + m*((x,y)) + m*((y,\u221e))\n      = x + y - x + \u221e - y\n      = \u221e.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nm*(A) \u2265 m*((-\u221e, a)) + m*((b ,\u221e))\n      = a + \u221e - b\n      = \u221e.\n\nTherefore,\n\nm*(A) = m*(A \u2229 (a,b)) + m*(A \u2229 ((a,b)^c))\n        \u2264 (\u221e - a - (\u221e -b)) + 0\n        = b - a.\n\nSince the length of the interval is b - a and this inequality holds for any subset A intersecting both the interval and its complement, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, every open interval (a, b) is Lebesgue measurable.", "A normed space is a vector space equipped with a norm, which is a function that assigns a non-negative length or size to each vector in the space. The norm satisfies three properties: \n\n1. Non-negativity: ||x|| \u2265 0 for all x in the vector space, and ||x|| = 0 if and only if x = 0.\n2. Homogeneity: ||\u03b1x|| = |\u03b1| ||x|| for all scalars \u03b1 and vectors x.\n3. Triangle inequality: ||x+y|| \u2264 ||x|| + ||y|| for all vectors x and y.\n\nNow let's show that the set of continuous real-valued functions on [a,b] with the supremum norm is a normed space.\n\nSuppose C([a,b]) is the set of continuous real-valued functions on [a,b]. The supremum norm, denoted as ||f||\u221e, is defined as:\n\n||f||\u221e = sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]}\n\nTo show that C([a,b]) with the supremum norm is a normed space, we need to verify that it satisfies the three properties of a normed space.\n\n1. Non-negativity:\nFor any function f in C([a,b]), we have |f(x)| \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 [a,b]. Therefore, sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]} \u2265 0. If f(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 [a,b], then sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]} = 0. Hence, the non-negativity property holds.\n\n2. Homogeneity:\nFor any scalar \u03b1 and function f in C([a,b]), we have:\n\n||\u03b1f||\u221e = sup{|\u03b1f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]}\n         = sup{|\u03b1||f(x)|| : x \u2208 [a,b]}\n         = |\u03b1| sup{|f(x)| : x \u2208 [a,b]}\n         = |\u03b1| ||f||\u221e\n\nTherefore, the homogeneity property holds.\n\n3.

In order for a set with an operation to form a group, it must satisfy four axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.\n\n1. Closure: For all elements a and b in G, the result of the operation * on a and b, denoted as a * b, is also an element of G. In other words, combining any two integers using addition will always yield another integer. This property holds true for the set of integers ZZ under addition.\n\n2. Associativity: For all elements a, b, and c in G, the operation * is associative. This means that (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). Addition of integers is associative since (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for any integers a, b, and c.\n\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for all elements g in G, e * g = g * e = g. This element e is called the identity element. In the case of the set of integers ZZ under addition, the identity element is 0 since adding 0 to any integer results in that integer remaining unchanged.\n\n4. Inverse: For every element g in G, there exists an element h in G such that g * h = h * g = e (the identity element). This element h is called the inverse of g and is denoted as g^(-1). In the set of integers ZZ under addition, for any integer n, its inverse would be -n since n + (-n) = (-n) + n = 0.\n\nTherefore, since the set of integers ZZ under addition satisfies all four group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverse), it forms a group.", "A vector space is a set V equipped with two operations: addition and scalar multiplication.

Let's denote this matrix as P.\n\nStep 2: Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\nWe need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. The eigenvalues are solutions \u03bb to the characteristic equation |P - \u03bbI| = 0 where I is an identity matrix with same dimensions as P. The eigenvectors v are then found by solving (P - \u03bbI)v = 0 for each value of \u03bb.\n\nStep 3: Check for Eigenvector Corresponding to Eigenvalue 1\nThe eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 will give us our stable state vector if it exists. If there is no such eigenvector (i.e., all other eigenvalues are less than or equal to one in absolute value), then P does not have a stable state.\n\nStep 4: Normalize Stable State Vector\nIf we do have an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue one, we need to normalize it so that it sums up to one. This means dividing each element of the vector by its total sum.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose we have a simple two-state system represented by the following transition matrix:\n```\nP = [[0.6, 0.4],\n     [0.3, 0.7]]\n```\n\nStep 2: The characteristic equation for this matrix is:\n```\n|P - \u03bbI| = (0.6-\u03bb)(0.7-\u03bb) - (0.4)(0.3) = \u03bb^2 -1.3\u03bb +0.18=0\n```\nSolving this equation gives us two eigenvalues: \u03bb_1 = 1 and \u03bb_2 = 0.3.\n\nThe corresponding eigenvectors are:\nFor \u03bb=1, we solve (P-I)v=0 which gives v=[0.5,0.5].\nFor \u03bb=0.3, we solve (P-0.3I)v=0 which gives v=[-1,3].\n\nStep 3: The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue one is [0.5, 0.5]. This represents our stable state.\n\nStep 4: To normalize this vector, we need to divide each element by the sum of all elements in the vector:\n```\nNormalized v = [0.5/ (0.5+0.5), 0.5/ (0.5+0.5)] \n             = [0.25 , 0.25]\n```\n\nSo, for this example, the stable state vector is [0.25 , 0.25].

We achieve this through a series of row operations.\n\nThe first row operation we'll perform is R2 - (R1*0), which doesn't change anything because we're subtracting zero. Similarly, R3 - (R1*0) doesn't change anything either.\n\nOur new matrix after these operations is:\n\n|1   \t1    \t1    \t|   \t|6 |\n|0   \t2    \t3    \t|->   \t|7 |\n|0   \t-9/5    \t-15/5= -3    \t|-9 |\n\nStep 3: Next, we want to make sure that our pivot element in row two (the number that's going to become a one eventually) is equal to one. To do this, divide row two by its pivot element which is two.\n\nOur new matrix after this operation is:\n\n|1   \t \t \t \t \t \t \t | \t \t \t | \t \t \t |\n|0   \t1   \t3/2=1.5  \t|->   \t3.5/2=1.75   \t \t \t |\n|0   \t \t \t \t |-9 |\n\nStep 4: Now we want to get zeros below our new pivot element in row two.

If there are two middle numbers (an even amount), then you take the average of those two numbers.\n\nFirst we need to order our data set from least to greatest: [1,2,2,3,4].\n\nSince our data set has an odd number of items (5), our median is just the middle item which is '2'.\n\nSo,the median of [1,2,2,3,4] is '2'.\n\nStep 3: Mode\nThe mode is simply the number that appears most frequently in our data set.\n\nIn our case,the number '2' appears twice which is more than any other number.So,the mode of [1 , 2 ,   ,   ,   ]is ' '.", "Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 pencil\nTo find out how much one pencil costs, we need to divide the total cost of 5 pencils by 5. \n\nSo, $1.25 / 5 = $0.25\n\nTherefore, one pencil costs $0.25.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost of 12 pencils\nNow that we know how much one pencil costs, we can multiply this price by the number of pencils we want to buy (which is 12).\n\nSo, $0.25 * 12 = $3.00\n\nTherefore, twelve pencils would cost you three dollars.", "Sure, let's solve this step by step.\n\nThe area under a curve is given by the definite integral of the function that defines the curve.

So, we need to evaluate the definite integral \u222b[0,2] x^2 dx.\n\nStep 1: Integrate\nThe antiderivative of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3. So, we have:\n\n\u222b[0,2] x^2 dx = [ (1/3)x^3 ] from 0 to 2\n= ((1/3)*2^3) - ((1/3)*0^3)\n= (8/3) - 0\n= (8/3)\n\nSo, \u222b[0,2] x^2 dx equals (8/3).\n\nStep 2: Interpretation\nSince we were looking for an area and areas can't be negative, we take absolute value of our result which gives us an area of A=|(8/3)|=8/3 square units.\n\nSo, the area under the curve y=x\u00b2 from x=0 to x=2 is A=8/3 square units.", "The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is given by the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st)f(t) dt, where s is a complex number.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the Laplace transform of e^(2t)cos(3t)e^(2t)cos(3t). However, there seems to be an error in the function you provided. The correct function should be e^(2t)*cos(3t)*e^(2t)*sin(3t). \n\nLet's proceed with computing its Laplace transform:\n\nStep 1: Write down the definition of the Laplace transform.\nThe Laplace transform F(s) of a function f(t) is given by:\nF(s) = \u222b[0,\u221e] e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nStep 2: Apply this definition to our function.\nF(s) = \u222b[0,\u221e] e^(-st)[e^(2t)*cos(3t)*e^(2t)*sin(3t)] dt\n\nStep 3: Simplify inside the integral.\nF(s) = \u222b[0,\u221e] [e^(-st+4t)]*[cos(3t)]*[sin(3t)] dt\n\nStep 4: Use properties of exponentials and trigonometric functions.\nWe know that cos(a)*sin(b)=1/2*[sin(a+b)+sin(a-b)]. \nApplying this property gives us:\nF(s)=1/2*{\u222b[0,\u221e] [e^(-st+4*t+6*t)]*[sin((6-5)t)+sin((6+5)t)]}dt\n\nStep 5: We can split this into two separate integrals using linearity property:\nF(s)=1/2*{\u222b[0,\u221e] [e^(-st+4*t+6*t)]*[sin((6-5)t)]}dt + 1/2*{\u222b[0,\u221e] [e^(-st+4*t+6*t)]*[sin((6+5)t)]}dt\n\nStep 6: Each of these integrals can be evaluated using standard Laplace transform pairs. The pair for sin(at) is a/(s^2+a^2). Applying these pairs gives us:\nF(s)=1/2*{[5/(s-5)^2 + 5/(s+5)^2]}\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of e^(2t)*cos(3t)*e^(2t)*sin(3t) is F(s)=1/2*[5/(s-5)^2 + 5/(s+5)^2].", "Sure, let's break this down.

In other words, it's a vector space where every Cauchy sequence (a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses) converges to an element in the space. \n\nHere, we're considering the set of all bounded sequences in \u211d with the sup norm. The sup norm (also known as the L\u221e norm or maximum norm) of a sequence is defined as the supremum (least upper bound) of the absolute values of its elements.\n\nTo show that this set forms a Banach space, we need to show two things:\n\n1.

But by definition of supremum and since {x_n} is Cauchy, this goes to zero as n goes to infinity. So for each fixed k > N we have x_k -> x as n -> \u221e for some x.\n\nNow we need to show that this limit x is also a bounded sequence. But this follows from triangle inequality: for any fixed m > N, we have |x_m| <= |x_m - x_k| + |x_k| which goes to infinity as k goes to infinity (because both terms on right side are non-negative and go to infinity).\n\nSo our limit x is indeed a bounded sequence, which means that our original Cauchy sequence converges to an element in our set.\n\nTherefore, the set of all bounded sequences in \u211d with the sup norm is a Banach space.", "To prove that the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) is continuous at all points except x = 1, we need to show that for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |f(x) - f(1)| < \u03b5 whenever |x - 1| < \u03b4, where f(1) is defined as lim[x\u21921] f(x).\n\nStep 1: Define f(1)\nFirst, let's compute the limit as x approaches 1 of f(x):\n\nlim[x\u21921] [(x^2 - 1)/(x - 1)] \n\nThis is an indeterminate form of type \"0/0\".

This is your prior, P(H).\n\nStep 2: Gather data\nYou need to know how likely you would be to see EE if HH were true (this is your likelihood, P(E|H)), and how likely you would be to see EE in general (regardless of whether HH were true or not), which we call total probability (P(E)).\n\nStep 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem\nSubstitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)\n\nThis gives you an updated probability for HH given EE.

The numerator P(X=x, Y=y): This represents the proportion of times in which both events X and Y occur together out of all possible outcomes. If we're looking at a specific outcome where we know that event Y has happened (i.e., we're in the subset defined by {Y=y}), then this numerator tells us how many times out of those specific outcomes also have event X happening (i.e., those specific outcomes are further filtered down to only include ones where {X=x}).\n\n2. The denominator P(Y=y): This represents our knowledge that we're in a world where event Y has happened (we're looking at outcomes in subset {Y=y}). The denominator acts as a normalizing factor to ensure that our conditional probability falls within range [0,1].\n\nSo when you divide numerator by denominator, you get a value which represents how likely it is for event X to happen given that you're already in a world where event Y has happened.\n\nThis concept is fundamental in many areas including statistics, machine learning and decision making under uncertainty.

If Player A chooses \"Fold\", then Player B's best response would be to \"Raise\". This doesn't form a Nash equilibrium because if Player A knew that Player B would raise after their fold decision, then Player A would have an incentive not to fold (because by folding they lose all chances of winning but by staying they at least have some chance).\n\n2. If Player A chooses \"Call\", then Player B's best response would also be to \"Call\". This could potentially form a Nash equilibrium if both players always choose to call and never change their strategy.\n\n3. If Player A chooses \"Raise\", then it depends on how much they raise by and what kind of betting structure we're using (limit or no-limit). In general though, if one player raises significantly more than what would be considered standard play (e.g., all-in), it could force an opponent into a situation where folding becomes their best response.\n\nSo in conclusion, for a simple two-player poker game without specific details about betting amounts or structures: \n\nA possible Nash equilibrium could be when both players always choose to call and never change this strategy because neither has an incentive to deviate from it (if they knew what the other player was doing).

Then we have:\n\n\u222b_C F . dr = \u222b_C (P dx + Q dy)\n\nBy Green's Theorem, this is equal to:\n\n\u222c_D (Q_x - P_y) dA\n\nSo, if you want to evaluate a line integral over a simple closed curve using Green's Theorem, you need to find a function z(x,y) such that dz/dx = Q and dz/dy = -P. Then you can evaluate the double integral of (Q_x - P_y) over the region D bounded by your curve.\n\nPlease note that this process assumes that your vector field F satisfies certain conditions for Green's Theorem to apply. Specifically, its component functions P and Q must have continuous first partial derivatives on an open region containing both D and C. Additionally, C must be piecewise-smooth and positively oriented (meaning it's traversed counterclockwise).", "The standard form of the equation of a circle with its center at the origin (0,0) and radius r is given by:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\nIn this case, since the radius is 5 units, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 5^2\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 25\n\nSo, the equation of your circle in standard form is: \n\nx^2 + y^2 = 25", "This is a linear programming problem where we want to maximize the objective function z=3x+4y, subject to the constraints x+y\u22644, x\u22650 and y\u22650.\n\nStep 1: Graph the Feasible Region\nThe first step in solving this problem is to graph the feasible region, which is defined by our constraints. The constraint x+y\u22644 forms a straight line on our coordinate system, and since we also have x\u22650 and y\u22650, our feasible region is the area below this line and above or on the x and y axes.\n\nStep 2: Identify Vertices of Feasible Region\nThe next step is to identify the vertices (corners) of our feasible region. The vertices are where two or more of our constraints intersect. In this case, because we only have one constraint besides x\u22650 and y\u22650, our vertex will be at (4, 0).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Objective Function at Vertices\nNow we need to evaluate our objective function z=3x+4y at these vertices. Plugging in x=4 and y=0 gives us z=3(4)+4(0)=12.\n\nStep 4: Compare Values of Objective Function\nCompare this value with those obtained from other vertices (if there were any). Since there are no other vertices for us to consider in this case, we can conclude that z has its maximum value of 12 at point (4, 0).\n\nSo, when x equals to or greater than zero but less than four and y equals zero then z will be maximum equal twelve.", "Step 1: Understand the Terminology\nBefore we begin, it's important to understand some basic geometry terms:\n\n- The lines that are cut by the transversal are called \"transversal lines\".\n- The angles that are formed on one side of the transversal and inside the two lines (they're between the two lines) are called \"interior angles\".\n- If these interior angles are on the same side of the transversal and one of them is facing up, then they're also known as \"same-side interior angles\".\n\nStep 2: Recall a Property of Same-Side Interior Angles\nThe property we need to recall here is that for any pair of parallel lines cut by a transversal:\n\n\"The sum of the measures of same-side interior angles is always equal to 180 degrees.\"\n\nThis property can be proven using various methods, such as using alternate interior angles or corresponding angles.\n\nStep 3: Apply this Property\nSo if we have two same-side interior angles on our diagram, we can say that:\n\n\"The measure of angle A + The measure of angle B = 180 degrees.\"\n\nThis holds true for all pairs of same-side interior angles formed by a transversal cutting across parallel lines.", "A Hilbert space is a complete inner product space, which means that every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to an element in the space. The proof of this property relies on the completeness of the underlying field (usually the real numbers or complex numbers) and the properties of the inner product.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\nStep 1: Understand what a Cauchy sequence is.\nA sequence {x_n} in a metric space (like a Hilbert space) is called a Cauchy sequence if for every positive number \u03b5 there exists an integer N such that for all m, n > N we have d(x_m, x_n) < \u03b5 where d is distance function.\n\nStep 2: Recall what it means for a metric space to be complete.\nA metric space is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space has a limit that is also in the same space.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that Hilbert spaces are complete.\nBy definition, a Hilbert space is an inner product space that is also complete with respect to the norm defined by the inner product. This means that any Cauchy sequence {x_n} of vectors in H converges to some limit vector x which also lies in H.\n\nStep 4: Use this property to show that every Cauchy sequence converges.\nGiven any Cauchy sequence {x_n}, we know from step 3 that it must converge to some limit vector x which also lies in our Hilbert Space H. Therefore, every Cauchy sequence in our Hilbert Space converges to an element within it.\n\nSo, using these properties and definitions from within our Hilbert Space, we can conclude that indeed every Cauchy Sequence within this Space will converge towards an Element also within this Space.", "Sure, let's find the Fourier series expansion of \\(f(x) = x^2\\) on the interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\).

A function f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] if the Riemann integral of f over [a, b] exists. This means that there exists a number I such that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a partition P of [a, b] such that for any choice of sample points in each subinterval of P, the Riemann sum S(P,f) = \u03a3[f(xi)]\u0394xi (where xi are sample points and \u0394xi are subintervals) satisfies |S(P,f) - I| < \u03b5.\n\n2. A function f is bounded on [a, b] if there exist numbers M and m such that m \u2264 f(x) \u2264 M for all x in [a,b].\n\nNow let's prove the statement:\n\nAssume that f is not bounded on [a,b]. This means that for any M > 0 there exists an x in [a,b] such that |f(x)| > M.\n\nLet's choose M = 1. Then we can find a sequence {x_n} in [a,b] such that |f(x_n)| > 1 for all n.\n\nNow consider any partition P of [a,b]. Since {x_n} is a sequence in [a,b], it must be contained within some finite subcollection of subintervals from P (because P is finite). Let's denote this subcollection as Q.\n\nSince |f(x_n)| > 1 for all n and x_n are inside Q which are inside P, it follows that \u03a3[|f(x_n)|*\u0394x_n] > \u03a3[1*\u0394x_n], where the sums are taken over all n and over all intervals in Q respectively.\n\nThis implies that no matter how small we choose our partition (which corresponds to making our subintervals smaller and smaller), we can always find a subcollection Q such that \u03a3[|f(x_n)|*\u0394x_n] > \u03a3[1*\u0394x_n]. \n\nBut this contradicts the definition of Riemann integrability: for a function to be Riemann integrable, we should be able to make this difference arbitrarily small by choosing a fine enough partition. \n\nTherefore, our assumption that f is not bounded on [a,b] must be incorrect. Hence, if f is Riemann integrable on [a,b], then it is indeed bounded on [a,b].", "A topological space is a set X together with a collection of subsets of X, called the topology on X, satisfying certain axioms. The purpose of defining a topology is to provide a general framework for understanding concepts such as convergence, continuity, and compactness.\n\nMore formally, let's define it:\n\n1.

So,\n\n= (4/3)*[-i*e^(-6\u03c0*i)-(-i*e^0)] \n= (4/3)*[-i*(cos(-6\u03c0)+isin(-6\u03c0))-(-i)] \n= (4/3)*[-i*(-1)-(-i)] \n= (4/3)*[i+i] \n= (8/3)*i\n\nNow substitute z = 2e^(it) into our second integral:\n\n\u222b(from t=0 to t=2\u03c0) i*2e^(it) dt\n= 2i*\u222b(from t=0 to t=2\u03c0) e^(it) dt\n= 2i*[0]\n= 0\n\nSo, the value of the original integral \u222b(z^2 + i)dz along the circle |z| = 2 is:\n\n(8/3)*i + 0\nwhich simplifies to:\n(8/3)*i", "Sure, let's simplify this expression step by step.\n\nStep 1: Apply the rule of exponents for a power raised to another power. The rule states that when you have a power raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. In this case, (x^3)^2 becomes x^(3*2) which is equal to x^6.\n\nSo, our expression now becomes: x^6 * x^-2\n\nStep 2: Apply the rule of exponents for multiplication with same base. The rule states that when you multiply two terms with same base, you add their exponents. In this case, x^6 * x^-2 becomes x^(6+(-2)) which simplifies to x^4.\n\nSo, our simplified expression is: \n(x^3)^2 * x^-2 = \nx^6 * x^-2 = \nx^(6+(-2)) = \nx^4"], "avg": 98.01369863013699, "std": 5.217182230833435, "median": 100.0, "moda": 100.0, "total_tokens": 29457, "total_tokens_send": 5740, "total_tokens_system": 49, "total_price": 3.68579, "total_questions": 75}}
